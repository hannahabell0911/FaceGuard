This is a Fritsing diagram that shows the assortment of sensors assembled within FaceGuard.

Led Light
The longer end is connected to GPIO 31
The shorter end is connected to GPIO pin 39
The led is connected to a 220-ohm Ohm Resistor

Button
One end is connected to Ground at GPIO pin 25
The other end is connected at GPIO pin 17 ( As we dont require 5V)

PIR sensor
The black wire is connected at GPIO pin 4
The Green wire is connected at GPIO pin 6
The Red wire is connected at GPIO pin 16

Speaker
The black wire is connected at GPIO pin 2
The black wire is connected at GPIO pin 9
The black wire is connected at GPIO pin 11

Camera Module
Through a Ribbon cable, CSI cable is going to be inserted in the Camera Module
