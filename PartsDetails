## Specifications
  ** Input voltage: DC 4.5~20V
  ** Static current: 50 uA
  ** Output signal: 0.3V (Output high when motion detected)
  ** Sentry angle: 110 degree

3  .  Speaker 


We got a class D audio amplifier on board and a 1 Watt, 8 ohm speaker.
Voltage Range: The audio signal can range up to the power pin voltage, which can be 3V or 5V peak-to-peak, depending on our setup.
Volume Adjustment:  During research, a lot of places said we might  have to use a screwdriver for adjusting the sound levels
