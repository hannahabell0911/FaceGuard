Due to the Picam not working , we have decieded to go with our USB camera for this project

The USB camera we have in this case is an HP webcam

To Set this UP for our project we require some initial setup

1. lsusb
   This checks if their is your USB connected
2. sudo apt fswebcam
3. fswebcam -r 1280x720 --no-banner /path/to/save/image.jpg (capuresimage)
4. pip3 install opencv-python

Now tha we have our USB cam setup we can INstall OPENCV Python Library

5. pip3 install opencv-python

now create a file whose name is cat capture.py

after creating the file we code it so that it takes the photo of the person in front of him

import cv2
import time

num=1
cap =cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
ret,img =cap.read()
cv2.imshow('Frame', img)
if cv2.waitkey(1) &0xFF==ord('c"):
cv2.imwrite('/home/pi/images/'str(num)+'.jpg',img)
print('Capture finished')
num= num+1
if num==4:
break
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
