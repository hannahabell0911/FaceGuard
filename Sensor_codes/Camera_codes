Due to the Picam not working , we have decieded to go with our USB camera for this project

The USB camera we have in this case is an HP webcam

To Set this UP for our project we require some initial setup

1. lsusb
   This checks if their is your USB connected
2. sudo apt fswebcam
3. fswebcam -r 1280x720 --no-banner /path/to/save/image.jpg (capuresimage)
4. pip3 install opencv-python

Now tha we have our USB cam setup we can INstall OPENCV Python Library

5. pip3 install opencv-python

now create a file whose name is cat capture.py

After creating the file we code it so that it takes the photo of the person in front of him

**_Create an Virtual Environment ENV inside the folder Projects _**

to go to this folder
**_virtualenv env_**
**_source env/bin/activate_**

inside the folder , installed the text to speech library using which pyttsx library

6. pip install pyttsx3
7. sudo apt-get install espeak

8. Connect to the speaker via bluetooth , might need a dew imports as well

9. test your speaker using this command
   aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav

10. Code for the camera_speaker.py

import cv2
import time
import pyttsx3
from datetime import datetime

def speak(text):
engine = pyttsx3.init()
rate = engine.getProperty('rate')  
 engine.setProperty('rate', rate - 40)  
 engine.say(text)
engine.runAndWait()

def take*picture():
filename = 'captured_image*{}.jpg'.format(datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d\_%H%M%S"))
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

    if not cap.isOpened():
        print("Cannot open camera")
        exit()


    time.sleep(3)

    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        print("Can't receive frame (stream end?). Exiting ...")
        return


    cv2.imwrite(filename, frame)

    cap.release()

print("Stand in front of the camera.")
speak("Please stand in front of the camera for 3 seconds.")
take_picture()
print("Picture taken!")
