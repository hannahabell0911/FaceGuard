**_ Data Flow for the folowing project is gonna be like the given order below _**

**_User Interaction:_**

A user presses the doorbell button or is detected by the PIR motion sensor.
The Raspberry Pi captures an image from the camera module.

**_Facial Recognition:_**

The captured image is processed for facial recognition on the Raspberry Pi.

If a recognized face is detected, the system takes appropriate action .

The face is gonna is displayed on the App regardless so if it is gonna be recognized or not , if it recognized the face the name will be outputted in the app as well

**_Real-time Updates:_**

PubNub facilitates real-time communication between the Raspberry Pi and the Android app .

Users receive real-time notifications and updates on the app when someone is at the door.

**_Backend Services (AWS Instances):_**

EC2 instances host the Flask web server, which provides API endpoints for communication with the Raspberry Pi and the Android app.

These instances handle user authentication, request processing, and interactions with the SQL database.
Data Storage:

Captured images and relevant sensor data are stored in the SQL database, which may be hosted on AWS RDS for reliability.
