   *** Date 5th December 2023 ***

   After Giving user the app so that they can play around in the app , We got the following feedbacks 

     1. Green topbar is not the best color , it wasnt matching with the purple used for the bottom navigation , which was looking a bit odd .

     2. The heading has to be in the middle of the screen to show its the title of the project 

     3. There was no back button in the topbar with which you could go back which was a hassale for the user to do 

     4. Suggested that the background color could be changed , could be made a little bit lighter 

     
     This was the general feedback we got from testing in the college with fellow students , with the following feedbacks changes to the frontend will be made accordinly and then User testing will be performed again 

   





   ***  User Testing ***  8th December

   Test subject -Tanish Afre 
   Profession   - 4th year Student in DKIT ( Software Development )
   Tech level   - Tech Savvy

 
   Did this user testing with my flatmate  Tanish , and asked him to be the user inside the house . 

   We simulated a dilevary guy came up to the the door for a dilivery , the motion sensor detects the the motion and the speaker says , Stand in front of the camera for 3 seconds . The camera takes in a picture and runs facial recognition , depending on the result its either gonna say the name of the person or display a unknown person on the livefeed . 


   So after simulating this Tanish  used the app to navigate into the livefeed to see a hardcoded image of  the unknown dilivery driver , he didnt wanna add him to the database as he was not a regular person , but if he wished to do so he could have .

   His feedbacks after using the app were , 
        
        1. The minimalist design allowed him to navigate into the live feed screen easily 

        2.In the live feed screen the information was enough for him to come to a onclusion weather he wants to attend the door or not .

        3. He said it would have been nicer if there was some kind of a red notification on the home Screen to hellp me  find the live feed view instantly 

          *** after a bit of research  and examining  different UI designs from pinterest , grey and purple make a good contrast , So that is why we have stuck with that in out UI ***

In the UI the  there is a bit of navigatio that neeedds to be done for a person to see their doorcam , there should be an Reminder or Notification which would help you know if someone is outside
