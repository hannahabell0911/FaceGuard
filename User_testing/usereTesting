   After Giving user the app so that they can play around in the app , We got the following feedbacks 

     1. Green topbar is not the best color , it wasnt matching with the purple used for the bottom navigation , which was looking a bit odd .

     2. The heading has to be in the middle of the screen to show its the title of the project 

     3. There was no back button in the topbar with which you could go back which was a hassale for the user to do 

     4. Suggested that the background color could be changed , could be made a little bit lighter 

     
     This was the general feedback we got from testing in the college with fellow students , with the following feedbacks changes to the frontend will be made accordinly and then User testing will be performed again
