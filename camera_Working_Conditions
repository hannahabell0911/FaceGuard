## Camera Module Working Conditions

The few questons that were arised in the feed back were the following questions

---

1. optimal sunlight condition for the camera to work
2. angles that the camera sensors is expected to perform from
3. Any other environmental factors that might have an effect

Answers to the following questions

1. Optimal Sunlight Conditions for the Camera to Work are :
   \*\* This is a low light sensetive and and a HDR camera , so this should work well in good light to low light , as this is not a night vision camera this will have its limitation at the might time

   \*\* To solve this problem we have to advice the user to setup a led white light beside the S,art door bell so that even at night time the face is well lit and clear

   \*\* having a exterrnal light will be very benificial as it will help the camera to capture the light and the face in a more accurate manner

   \*\* Also the way less light is a hinderance over- exposure is also a problem , if it is very sunny and the face is overexposed , the camera module is gonna be error prone

   \*\* To solve this problem , there ccan be a shed above the door bell to eliminate the problem of over exposure

2. Angles that the Camera Sensors are Expected to Perform From

   \*\*With an effective focal length of 4.74mm and a 35mm equivalent of 28-30mm, the camera is versatile for a range of angles, from wide landscapes to more focused subjects.

   \*\* The person on the door can stand a meter away from the camera and the minimum distance would be 30 cm from the camera .

   \*\* it is necessary for the person on the door to be standing in front of the camera and looking straight into the camera , so that the camera can take a shot of their face from the front and not side angles

3. Other Environmental Factors That Might Have an Effect

   \*\* Extreme temperatures and high humidity will affect performance and longevity. It's advisable to use the camera within recommended environmental conditions.

   \*\* While not specified, camera module is sensitive to dust and moisture. Using the camera in a protective case when in dusty or potentially wet environments is recommended.

   \*\* for the following problems we will have the camera module protected within the box so that the lens dosent get dusty and moisture on it , it could be under a transperent film which helps prevent the dust and moisture .



In conclusion , this device will have to be supported with a light / lamp for it to work at night and if in your area it gets too sunny at times , it is preferred to have a shed over your device for it to minimize the problem of over exposure and reduce the chances of rain damaging the device .
